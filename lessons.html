        <p>Alicia's teaching can be defined by great personal attention to every pupil.
          At the same time she tries to connect them with each other on regular occasions every 6-8 weeks with
          performances and playing together. Also she likes to involve family or friends of the pupil if they can play
          an instrument too, having such precious personal memories of playing together with her own family.

          But, since the lessons are highly personalised, it can also be that the pupil has only lessons on his own,
          just like it fits everyone's needs.
          Alicia loves to challenge herself and to give every pupil different repertoire, so she stays very vivid in her
          weekly program and she can serve everyone's personal preference.

      <p>Her teaching can further be defined by strong structure and coaching, always putting "feelgood" first. She can
        also teach in multiple languages and via online lessons.
        She offers lessons with lots of flexibility or lessons based on a year contract. This contract provides a
        substantial discount and is meant for schoolchildren.
        Her prices follow the advice of the union for musicians.

        Her lessons are always 60 minutes. This way there is space for a relaxed setting, having time to practise
        practising and optimize results.
        Sibling's can have a combined time together, having the lesson privately and spending time reading or drawing
        while the other one has the lesson.
        The lessons take place in the familyhouse next to theater Carré, where the praxis has been located since the
        beginning, with a spectaculair view at the river Amstel.
        Quartetlessons are on an alternative location.
